    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I'm David Freitag, welcome to my portfolio site,</p>
    <p>
        I'm a full stack developer with experience in javascript, react, node,
        python, and a little bit of C. But don't let that fool you I'm always up
        for learning a new language. To give a bit of background I was working a
        job as a back office operator at a credit union data processor. I did
        that for about a year then I decided that it wasn't for me. I have
        always had an interest in programming but I never did anything with it
        until I decided to go to Lambda. Doing this has been one of the best
        decisions I have ever made.
